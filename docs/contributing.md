# Contributing to the Shristyverse LLM Suite

1. Fork `Shristyverse/shristyverse-llm-suite` and create a feature branch (`feature/your-change`).
2. Keep code and documentation changes scoped; ship design proposals separately from implementation.
3. Run project-level linting and tests for any areas you touch (see module READMEs for commands).
4. Update relevant docs, including evaluation notes and configuration templates.
5. Open a pull request with a summary, test evidence, and rollout considerations.
