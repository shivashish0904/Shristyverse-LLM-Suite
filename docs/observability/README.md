# Observability Blueprint (Draft)

This directory will house the shared telemetry contracts, dashboard snapshots, and runbook templates for the Shristyverse LLM Suite.

## Targets
- Logging schema definitions for agent interactions.
- Metrics catalog shared across MCP and voice experiences.
- Tracing instrumentation guidelines for multi-agent flows.

## Next Steps
- Import the existing Grafana dashboard exports.
- Document alert routing rules and escalation policy.
- Publish the on-call playbook for GA launches.
