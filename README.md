# 🌌 Shristyverse LLM Apps

Welcome to the official collection of Large Language Model applications curated and maintained by **Shristyverse G.K.** This repository houses production-ready experiences, internal tools, research experiments, and learning resources born out of our 2025 initiative to make trustworthy intelligent systems widely accessible.

## 🚀 What You’ll Find
- **Advanced AI Agents** – multi-agent and autonomous workflows tailored for real-world operations.
- **MCP Integrations** – Modular Client Protocol adapters that show how we connect language models with existing infrastructure.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation** – reference implementations for memory-backed assistants across different modalities.
- **Voice & Multimodal Interfaces** – explorations into speech, audio, and hybrid user experiences.
- **Learning Tracks** – tutorials and crash courses that we use internally to onboard engineers and researchers.
- **Operations Tooling** – observability, evaluation, and governance assets curated for production readiness.

All content is authored, assembled, or verified by the Shristyverse team. Examples in this repository assume familiarity with modern Python tooling, container workflows, and standard data-engineering practices.

## 📂 Repository Layout
- `advanced_ai_agents/` – high-agency orchestration patterns, planning loops, and evaluation harnesses.
- `advanced_llm_apps/` – specialist assistants and domain-focused copilots ready for customization.
- `ai_agent_framework_crash_course/` – progressive lessons covering the foundations of agent design.
- `docs/` – architecture notes, internal guidelines, and whitepapers.
- `mcp_ai_agents/` – MCP-compliant adapters and services.
- `rag_tutorials/` – retrieval augmented generation playbooks.
- `starter_ai_agents/` – lightweight entry points for new contributors.
- `voice_ai_agents/` – speech-enabled and multimodal prototypes.

Each directory includes its own README with deeper guidance. For internal reference, align any new contribution with our documentation style guide before opening a review.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. Clone this repository and ensure you are working inside a clean Python 3.10+ environment.
2. Install dependencies declared in the respective module folders (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).
3. Populate local environment variables using the templates provided in each app (for example, `.env.example` files) or the shared blueprints under `configs/templates`.
4. Follow the module-specific README instructions to run demos or launch services.

Wherever configuration values are required, supply credentials issued by Shristyverse G.K. or the approved internal key vault. Public or third-party credentials are neither bundled nor supported.

## 🏛 Architecture

Review `docs/architecture/README.md` for the platform blueprint, release rings, and cross-cutting initiatives. It also links to governance and evaluation roadmaps and flags shared configuration surfaces under `configs/templates/`.

## 🤝 Contributing
- Follow the branching workflow documented in `docs/contributing.md`.
- Keep discussions and decision records up to date inside the `docs/` directory.
- Submit pull requests only after running the linting and test suites defined alongside each project.

All inbound contributions are reviewed for compliance with the Shristyverse G.K. License 2025 and our internal security checklist. By submitting a contribution, you acknowledge that ownership transfers to Shristyverse G.K. as described in the license.
